# On-conveyor-cargo-identification-using-opencv

本项目使用opencv的边缘检测算法实现了传送带上的物品检测和物品间隔计算。运行速度很快，本来是想部署在树莓派3B+上或者支持opencv的智能相机上。做好之后甲方失联了，所以本项目无疾而终。目前只实现了算法原型，离最终的部署还是有一定差距的。现在开源出来，包括代码和测试数据。希望对大家的学习和开发之路有所帮助。

This project uses the edge detection algorithm in opencv lib to realize the cargo detection and cargo interval calculation on the conveyor. It runs very fast. It was intended to be deployed on a Raspberry PI 3B+ or Opencv-enabled smart camera. After the first demonstration, Party A disappeared. Therefore, the project was terminated. At present, only the prototype algorithm has been implemented, and there is still a certain gap between the final deployment. It is now open source, including code and test data. I hope it will be helpful to your learning and development.
